### Problem Statement
Currently, using the Cardinal Codex project with a frontend not specifically dedicated to it is extremely difficult. There is a need to enable the creation of self-contained game artifacts, allowing for seamless integration with any frontend without requiring the development of custom components.

### Proposed Solution
Enhance the CLI tool to fulfill the following roles:
1. **Artifact Creation**:
   - Design a way to compile games into "artifacts" that are fully usable by any frontend.
   - Define the artifact format (e.g., bundled JSON, binaries, or libraries) to include rules, cards, TOML configurations, and scripts.

2. **Validation**:
   - Add functionality to validate user inputs such as:
     - Rules for logical consistency and completeness.
     - Card packs and TOML files to ensure conformity to schemas.
     - Script syntaxes and runtime checks.
   
3. **Compilation**:
   - Transform user inputs into a machine-readable format that is optimized for frontends.
   - Bundle all assets, including card metadata, rules, and scripts for easy distribution.

4. **Testing**:
   - Include the ability to simulate and debug user inputs via mock tests or dry-run modes.
   - Provide feedback on rule edge cases, card interactions, and game balance during compilation.

### Benefits
- Increased usability of the project by a wide range of frontends.
- Improved developer experience by providing actionable feedback during the asset creation process.
- Streamlined integration and reduced development efforts for consumers of the project.

### Next Steps
- Define the finalized artifact format specification.
- Prototype the enhanced CLI features.
- Gather feedback from stakeholders and align on requirements before full implementation.
