# SCHEMA VALIDATION EXAMPLE
# =======================
# This file demonstrates Cardinal's TOML schema validation.
#
# To see validation in action:
# 1. Open this file in VS Code
# 2. Install the "Even Better TOML" extension (if prompted)
# 3. Look for red squiggly lines showing validation errors
#
# This file intentionally has errors to demonstrate validation.
# DO NOT use this as a template for real cards!

# ERROR 1: Missing required field "card_type"
# The schema requires: id, name, and card_type
id = "invalid_example"
name = "This Card Has Errors"
# card_type is MISSING - VS Code should show this as an error!

# ERROR 2: Invalid field name
# The schema defines valid fields - anything else triggers an error
invalid_field_name = "this field doesn't exist in the schema"
# VS Code should highlight this as "Additional properties are not allowed"

# For comparison, here's what a VALID card looks like:
# Uncomment these lines to fix the errors:
#
# id = "example_card"
# name = "Example Card"
# card_type = "creature"    # Required!
# cost = "1R"               # Optional
# description = "A valid card with all required fields"
#
# See cards/goblin_scout.toml for a real example.
